## Overview
This was a portfolio I designed with inspiration stemming from wanting to learn more about making a responsive design.
While I struggled to fill out the content of the portfolio, I tinkered around with the idea of using cards as a template to fill it out.

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Use
- When you click on any card image at the top of a card, that will take you the deployed application
- Clicking on the "View Repository" button on the bottom of the cards will take you to the application repository.
- When you resize the screen you should notice a change in background and even card size below certain thresholds.

## Acknowledgements
I struggled a bit on my own when making the flexbox, this tutorial helped me a lot to get a better understanding.

This also helped me remove the stretched effect from the images
